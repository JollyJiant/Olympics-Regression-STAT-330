# Olympics-Regression-STAT-330

The final project for STAT 330 Statistical Modeling II at BYU. Our group of 3 students performed EDA and regression modeling to answer questions on a dataset of our choice. We compiled data from multiple sources to create a dataset of economic and political features to determine if they influence a country's Olympic Medal winnings. Our report describes our initial questions and how we used our data to create to answer those questions, concluding with interpretations of our regression model and other statistical findings.

As a contributor to the group, I refined my ability to code in R and developed the regression models, which sharpened my statistical modeling and reasoning skills.
